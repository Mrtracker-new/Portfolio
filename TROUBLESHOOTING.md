# Uh Oh, Something's Not Working? Let's Fix It! üîß

Don't worry - I've got you covered! Here are solutions to pretty much everything that could go wrong.

## First Things First - The "Have You Tried Turning It Off and On Again?" Fix

### If the page won't load or keeps loading forever:

**Good news!** I already fixed all the JavaScript errors that were causing this. But if you're still seeing issues:

1. **Do a hard refresh**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (or `Cmd+Shift+R` on Mac)
   - This forces your browser to reload everything fresh

2. **Clear your browser cache**:
   - Chrome: Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Clear browsing data
   - Firefox: Options ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Clear Data
   - Honestly, 90% of weird issues are just cache problems üòÖ

3. **Check for errors**: Press `F12` and look at the Console tab
   - If you see red text, that's an error - screenshot it!

## Okay, Let's Debug Some Specific Stuff

### Theme Toggle Isn't Switching

**What's happening:** You click the sun/moon icon and... nothing?

**Try this:**
1. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) - seriously, this fixes it 80% of the time
2. Open console (F12) and look for any red errors
3. Make sure your browser allows localStorage (some privacy modes block it)
4. Try opening the site in incognito mode - if it works there, it's a browser extension causing issues

**Still stuck?** Your browser might have JavaScript disabled. Check your browser settings!

### Typing Animation Is Just... Not Typing

**What's happening:** The hero section should be typing text, but it's either blank or just sitting there

**Here's the deal:**
- The animation has a 1-second delay on purpose (so the page can load first)
- Make sure JavaScript is actually running
- Press F12, go to Console, and type this:
  ```javascript
  document.getElementById('typed-text')
  ```
  If it says "null", something deleted that element from the HTML!

**Quick fix:** If you edited the HTML, make sure you didn't accidentally delete the `<span id="typed-text"></span>` part.

### Project Filters Just Sitting There Looking Pretty But Not Filtering

**What's happening:** You click "AI/ML" or "Web Apps" and all the projects just... stay there?

**Common causes:**
1. **Hard refresh first** - I know, I say this a lot, but it really works!
2. Check the console (F12) for errors
3. If you added new projects, make sure they have this attribute:
   ```html
   <article class="project" data-category="web fullstack">
   ```
   Without `data-category`, the filter doesn't know what to do with it!

**Pro tip:** Each project can have multiple categories (like "web fullstack" or "ai-ml fullstack")

### Where's My Cool Custom Cursor?

**Wait, before you panic:** The custom cursor ONLY works on desktop! Here's why:

- If you're on a phone or tablet, you won't see it (touch screens don't need cursors)
- If your browser window is smaller than 920px wide, it's hidden
- This is intentional! Custom cursors on mobile are weird and nobody likes them

**On desktop and still don't see it?**
- Try moving your mouse around (it follows with a slight delay - that's the smooth effect!)
- Make sure your window is wider than 920px
- Check if you accidentally commented out the cursor code in script.js

### Images Are Broken/Not Loading

**What's happening:** You see those annoying broken image icons üñºÔ∏è

**Let's fix it:**

1. **Check the folder structure**. Should look like this:
   ```
   Portfolio/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sangu.png
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai.png
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ecom.png
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ folio.png
   ```

2. **File names are case-sensitive!** `Sangu.png` is NOT the same as `sangu.png`

3. **Check the HTML**. Should be:
   ```html
   <img src="images/sangu.png" alt="...">
   ```
   Not `src="sangu.png"` or `src="/images/sangu.png"` (no slash at the start!)

4. **Use PNG or JPG files** - they work everywhere

### Timeline Not Doing Its Hover Dance

**What's happening:** The timeline looks fine but doesn't animate when you hover?

**Here's what to check:**
- Make sure you've scrolled to the timeline section (the fade-in needs to finish first)
- Hover slowly and deliberately over the timeline items
- If you have a browser extension that messes with CSS, try disabling it
- Check if you accidentally disabled CSS transitions in the dev tools

**Fun fact:** The dots are supposed to scale up and glow when you hover. If they're not doing that, CSS isn't loading properly!

### Mobile Menu Won't Open (That Hamburger Icon Is Just Chilling)

**What's happening:** You click the three lines (hamburger menu) and nothing happens?

**First, make sure it's actually supposed to show:**
- The mobile menu only appears when the screen is LESS than 920px wide
- If you're on a full-size desktop screen, you'll just see the regular navigation
- Test it properly by pressing F12 ‚Üí clicking the device toggle ‚Üí picking a phone

**If it still won't open:**
- Look for JavaScript errors (you know the drill - F12 console)
- Try clicking directly on the three lines
- Make sure you didn't accidentally delete the menu code from the HTML

### 8. Testimonials Cards Not Showing
**Symptoms**: Testimonial section is empty or broken

**Solutions**:
- Scroll to testimonials section
- Check if section has `fade-in-section` class
- Wait for scroll animation
- Verify HTML structure is complete

---

### 9. Parallax Effect Not Working
**Symptoms**: Hero section doesn't move on scroll

**This is Normal if**:
- You're on mobile (parallax disabled < 920px)
- You haven't scrolled yet

**Solutions** (for desktop):
- Scroll down the page
- Check if window width > 920px
- Verify no JavaScript errors

---

### 10. Contact Form Not Working
**Symptoms**: Form doesn't open email client

**Expected Behavior**:
The form uses `mailto:` links, which opens your default email client.

**Solutions**:
- Set up default email client (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
- Or implement a backend solution:
  - [Formspree](https://formspree.io)
  - [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com)
  - [Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/products/forms)

## Browser-Specific Issues

### Chrome/Edge
- Usually works perfectly
- Check if hardware acceleration is enabled
- Try disabling extensions

### Firefox
- May need to allow popups for mailto links
- Check if JavaScript is enabled
- Try safe mode (Help ‚Üí Troubleshoot Mode)

### Safari
- Some CSS animations may differ slightly

## Performance Issues

### Page Loads Slowly
**Solutions**:
- Optimize/compress images
- Check internet connection
- Disable particle canvas if needed:
  ```javascript
  // Comment out in script.js
  // animate();
  ```

### Animations Stuttering
**Solutions**:
- Close other browser tabs
- Disable custom cursor:
  ```css
  /* In style.css */
  body { cursor: default !important; }
  .custom-cursor, .cursor-follower { display: none !important; }
  ```
- Reduce particle count in `script.js`
